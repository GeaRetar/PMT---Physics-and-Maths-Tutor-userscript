# PMT---Physics-and-Maths-Tutor-userscript

Userscript for PMT - Physics & Maths Tutor.

Download Tampermonkey extention, download the PMT 3.0 userscript, import file, enjoy.

Made because I got annoyed with how the notes or old papers would open not taking up the full browser so I made this script to pull the PDF file link from the URL and present it on the browser nicely.


+ You could also do this by looking at the HTML of the site and pulling it from there but this method worked more nicely
